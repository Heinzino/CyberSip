# Self-Regulated Portable Heated Mug

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a self-regulated portable heated mug, which features a 7-segment temperature display controlled by an AVR128DB28 microcontroller. 
The design enhances user experience by allowing real-time monitoring and control of beverage temperature. A thermistor continuously measures the drink's temperature, activating the heating pads when the temperature falls below 60 degrees Celsius.

## Features

- Self-regulating heating system for optimal temperature maintenance
- 7-segment temperature display for real-time monitoring
- Compact and portable design for easy transport
- Durable metal cup interior for improved heat retention

## Code

The main code for the project is located in this repository. It handles the functionality of the temperature display and the heating control.
